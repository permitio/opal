### If I'm using OPAL just for Kubernetes level authorization, what benefits do I get from using OPAL compared to [kube-mgmt](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/kube-mgmt)?

<div

    padding: "4px 8px",
    backgroundColor: "#8573ff",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    width: "120px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",

  }}

  Kubernetes
</div>

#### Answer:

OPAL solves the most pain for application-level authorization; where things move a lot faster than the pace of deployments or infrastructure configurations. But it also shines for usage with Kubernetes. We'll highlight three main points:

1. Decoupling from infrastructure / deployments: With OPAL you can update both policy and data on the fly - without changing the underlying deployment/ or k8s configuration whatsoever (While still using CI/CD and GitOps).
   While you can load policies into OPA via kube-mgmt, this practice can become very painful rather quickly when working with complex policies or dynamic policies (i.e. where someone can use a UI or an API to update policies on the fly) - OPAL can be very powerful in allowing other players (e.g. customers, product managers, security, etc. ) to affect policies or subsets of them.

2. Data updates and Data distribution- OPAL allows to load data into OPA from multiple sources (including 3rd party services) and maintain their sync.

3. OPAL provides a more secure channel - allowing you to load sensitive data (or data from authorized sources) into OPA.

   - OPAL-Clients authenticate with JWTs - and the OPAL-server can pass them credentials to fetch data from secure sources as part of the update.

   It may be possible to achieve a similar result with K8s Secrets, though there is no current way to do so with kube-mgmt. In addition this would tightly couple (potentially external) services into the k8s configuration.

### Can I run the OPAL-server without `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` ?

<div
  style={{
    padding: "4px 8px",
    backgroundColor: "#8573ff",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    width: "120px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",

    fontWeight: "bolder",
    fontSize: "0.8rem",
    borderRadius: "4px",
  }}

  Networking
</div>

#### Answer:

Yes, you can potentially choose to run it as a single instance with a single worker in which case you don’t need the broadcaster channel. The broadcaster, AKA the backbone pub-sub, is used to sync between opal-server instances, one instance doesn't require syncing of course.
This is mainly useful for light-workloads (Where a single worker is enough) and development environments (where you just don't want the hassle of setting up a Kafka / Redis / Postgres service)

### Does OPAL provide health-check routes ?

<div
  style={{
    padding: "4px 8px",
    backgroundColor: "#8573ff",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    width: "340px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bolder",
    fontSize: "0.8rem",
    borderRadius: "4px",
  }}
>
  Devops, maintenance and observability
</div>

#### Answer:

Yes both OPAL-server and OPAL-client serve a health check route at `"/healthcheck"`

### How does OPAL guarantee that the policy data is actually in sync with the actual application state. We get that OPAL server publishes updates to OPAL client but is there error correction in place.

#### Answer:

Thanks to the lightweight nature of the OPAL pub/sub channel - clients very quickly learn of changes in the data state even before they have
the data itself - this allows the **OPAL-clients**, their **data-fetcher components**, their **managed OPA instances**
(OPAL-client stores this state in OPA), and **other subscribing services** to respond to data change and handle the interim
state. The simplest form of here is

- Your Rego policy can use the health state value to make different interim decisions OPAL.
- The OPAL client will continue to try and fetch data the data until it gets it (with exponential backoff).

You can read more about the mechanism **[here](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks)**.

### We are using the official OPAL postgres data fetcher. When the OPAL Client is being spun up, it will fetch the data from the postgres instance it is connected to. We are concerned that during that spin up phase, if any updates to the data source happen, how is it handled?

<div
  style={{
    padding: "4px 8px",
    backgroundColor: "#8573ff",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    width: "140px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bolder",
    fontSize: "0.8rem",
    borderRadius: "4px",
  }}
>
  Data Updates
</div>

#### Answer:

Once connected, the OPAL-client will start tracking data update events that you send and handle them. It does so
from the start even before getting the first base data - and will process the events in order - so you don't need
to track them specifically.

### Does the client fetch the update messages from the OPAL Server and re-run them after it builds the initial state?

#### Answer:

The client does not re-run, but more correctly spins tasks to update as events come, and processes them once possible.
Usually loading the client is pretty fast, so we haven't encountered issues here. In general this is not a pure OPAL problem
but a general multi process read/write sync challenge. If it is an issue for you, I can suggest a few options:

- Create a clone source where clients get their base data set, instead of working directly with the rapidly changing data source (this can be another OPA+OPAL instance for example - almost like a master node)
- Temporarily lock access to the database for writing until the client is ready - (reader/writer lock pattern)

#### I'm configuring OPAL to run with a kafka backbone. We have an existing kafka setup using SASL authentication. I can't see any examples for configuring this with authentication. What's the best way to achieve this?

<div
  style={{
    padding: "4px 8px",
    backgroundColor: "#8573ff",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    width: "120px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bolder",
    fontSize: "0.8rem",
    borderRadius: "4px",
  }}
>
  Security
</div>

### Answer:

At a glance it seems the current broadcaster Kafka backend doesn't support SASL. You can read more [here](https://github.com/permitio/broadcaster/blob/master/broadcaster/_backends/kafka.py).
Unless there is a way to pass this configuration via URL to the underlying Kafka consumer.

It can be supported without a ton of work (as AIOKafka does support it), but currently the SASL params are not exposed.

I would suggest one of the following:

- You can upgrade the broadcaster code to expose these variables - either as part of the URL, or as env-vars. (If you do please consider contributing this back to the project).
- Use a Kafka proxy to add the needed params - e.g. [kafka-proxy](https://github.com/grepplabs/kafka-proxy).
- Open an issue on our GitHub requesting we do item #1 for you; and we will do our best to prioritize it.

### How can I plug data into OPAL?

#### Answer:

OPAL is extensible, its plugin mechanism is called fetchers. With them you can pipe data into OPA from 3rd party sources.
You can learn more about OPAL fetchers here or simply try to use an [existing one](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres).

### Which is the better mechanism to use for realtime? OPA http.fetch() or OPAL Client fetch module?

#### Answer:

Unless the data source is a very stable ingrained service (part of the core system), and the queries to it are simple
(low data volume and frequency) - We would always recommend the data fetcher option. It decouples the problem of loading
data from querying the policy.

### How can we trigger the OPAL data fetch from within Rego?

#### Answer:

First of all, you are not really supposed to trigger it from Rego - the idea is usually for it to be async and decoupled
from the policy itself. Instead, the data source or the service mutating it are the ones sending the triggers to OPAL,
handling the updates in the background - independent of any policy queries.

That being said, you can technically use `http.send()` to trigger an update - as the API trigger is restful.

### How does OPAL handle the situation when an OPA container is restarted or gets out-of-sync with source system ?
