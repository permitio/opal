## Custom Data Fetcher Providers

## Logging and Monitoring

OPAL+ provides advanced logging and monitoring capabilities to help you track and debug your OPAL+ deployment.

#### Connect to logging system

On production, we advise you to connect OPAL+ to your logging system to collect and store the logs.
Configure the [OPAL_LOG_SERIALIZE](/getting-started/configuration) environment variable to `true` to serialize logs in JSON format.

#### Monitor OPAL Servers and Clients

OPAL+ provides monitoring endpoints to help you track the health of your OPAL+ servers and clients.
Configure the [OPAL_STATISTICS_ENABLED=true](/getting-started/configuration) environment variable to enable the statistics APIs.

You can then monitor the state of your OPAL+ cluster by calling the `/stats` API route on the server.
```bash
curl http://opal_server:8181/stats -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# { "uptime": "2024-07-14T14:55:02.710Z", "version": "0.7.8", "client_count": 1, "server_count": 1 }
```

You can also get detailed information about the OPAL+ clients and servers by calling the `/statistics` API route on the server.
```bash
curl http://opal_server:8181/statistics -H "Authorization: Bear <token>"
```
```json
{
  "uptime": "2024-07-14T14:54:09.809Z",
