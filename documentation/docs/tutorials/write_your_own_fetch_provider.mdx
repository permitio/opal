# How to extend OPAL with custom Fetch Providers

This tutorial will explain **how to write and use your own custom fetch providers**, so that OPAL can pull state from a custom service into the authorization layer (i.e: OPA).

:::note
Before you proceed to implement your own, please check out the list of the **[available Fetch Providers](/fetch-providers)** we already have in place.
:::

The guide has 3 main parts:

1. [Background](#background) - explains why we need custom fetch providers, gives examples for use cases and explains what fetch providers are.
2. [Writing your own fetch provider](#writing-providers) - step-by-step explanation how to write your own fetch provider.
3. [Using a custom fetch provider](#using-providers) - given a custom fetch provider (either published by someone else or written by you), shows how to use the provider in your own OPAL setup.

## TL;DR

This tutorial is long and detailed, but the gist of it is:

- All Fetch Providers are simply python classes that derive from [BaseFetchProvider](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/fetch_provider.py#L9).
- You need to implement the fetching logic in `_fetch_()` and optionally `_process_()`.
- Once you finish implementing your provider, you can publish it as a pip package. You can then tell OPAL to use it with the configuration env var `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES`.
- We created a well-documented [example fetch provider for Postgres SQL](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres). If you prefer to learn from a real code example you can simply clone it and play with it.

## <a name="background"></a>Background

One of the core features of OPAL (besides realtime syncing of authorization state) is the ability to **aggregate state** from multiple data sources into OPA.

### Use cases for fetching authorization state from external sources

1. We might want to allow certain actions only for paying users. In order to know if the user is a paying user, the authorization layer needs to fetch billing data from a 3rd party service (i.e: **Stripe**).
2. We might want to allow a customer success rep to impersonate a user belonging to one of our customers for demo purposes. But only if the customer success rep is assigned a ticket in **Salesforce**.
3. In our architecture we have a microservice that manages our custom RBAC roles, we want to pull the list roles and their permissions from the **roles service** into OPA.

### What are OPAL fetch providers?

Fetch Providers are the (pluggable) components OPAL uses to fetch data from sources on demand. You can think about each provider as a _plugin_ or a _driver_ that can teach OPAL how to fetch data from a new data-source.

OPAL was designed to be extensible, and you can easily create more fetch providers to enable OPAL to fetch data from your own unique sources (e.g. a SaaS service, a new DB, your own proprietary solution, etc).

## <a name="writing-providers"></a>Writing your own fetch provider

In this section we will show a step-by-step tutorial how to write an OPAL fetch provider.

We already created a [fully-functional fetch provider for Postgres SQL](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres), that you may use if you need to fetch data from postgres. This fetcher is well documented and you can learn from it how to write your own fetch providers. We will also reference code examples from this fetch provider in our tutorial.

### Step 1 - creating your project file hierarchy

All Fetch Providers are simply python classes that derive from [BaseFetchProvider](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/fetch_provider.py#L9).

Fetch Providers are loaded into the [fetcher-register](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/fetcher_register.py) from a list of python modules specified by the OPAL configuration env var `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES`.

In order for OPAL to be able to load your fetch-provider python module (by _load_ we mean _import inside python_), the module must be installed on your machine. The best way to install python modules is to publish them as a [pip package](https://pypi.org/).

Your minimum file tree should look like this:

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── opal_fetcher_postgres
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
```

It's pretty basic but we'll go through it anyways:

- `LICENSE` - an open-source license. OPAL itself uses the Apache 2.0 license.
- `README.md` - a readme that describes your package, typically includes instructions how to install and use your fetch provider (recommended).
- `opal_fetcher_postgres` - will be probably have a different name in your own fetch-provider, this is the name of the package after it is installed by pip. (In other words, the import inside python will look like this: `import opal_fetcher_postgres`).
- `requirements.txt` - other pip packages required by your fetch-provider. At minimum, you will need the following packages: `opal-common` and `pydantic`.
- `setup.py` - This file includes instructions how to install your fetch-provider package. [You can copy from us](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/setup.py).

### Step 2 - your provider module (general structure)

Under your module folder, you should typically have two files:

```
.
├── __init__.py
└── provider.py
```

The `provider.py` module should have the following structure:

- A class inheriting from `FetcherConfig` - your config class.
- A class inheriting from `FetchEvent` - your event class.
- A class inheriting from `BaseFetchProvider` - your fetch provider class.

This example code shows the class structure and some comments:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from opal_common.fetcher.fetch_provider import BaseFetchProvider
from opal_common.fetcher.events import FetcherConfig, FetchEvent


class PostgresFetcherConfig(FetcherConfig):
    """
    Config for PostgresFetchProvider, inherits from `FetcherConfig`.
    * In your own class, you must set the value of the `fetcher` key to be your custom provider class name.
    """
    fetcher: str = "PostgresFetchProvider"


class PostgresFetchEvent(FetchEvent):
    """
    When writing a custom provider, you must create a custom FetchEvent subclass, just like this class.
    In your own class, you must:
    * set the value of the `fetcher` key to be your custom provider class name.
    * set the type of the `config` key to be your custom config class (the one just above).
    """
    fetcher: str = "PostgresFetchProvider"
    config: PostgresFetcherConfig = None


class PostgresFetchProvider(BaseFetchProvider):
    """
    The fetch-provider logic, must inherit from `BaseFetchProvider`.
    """
    ...
```

You may also reference the [provider module from the postgres fetcher](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/src/opal_fetcher_postgres/provider.py).

### Step 3 - implementing your FetcherConfig and FetchEvent

Each fetch-provider might require specific values that will be passed to it as part of its configuration. The configuration is simply a [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/) model that must derive from the `FetcherConfig` class.

Let's analyze the real code of the [PostgresFetcherConfig](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/opal_fetcher_postgres/provider.py#L31) class from the postgres fetcher.

```python
class PostgresConnectionParams(BaseModel):
    """
    if one does not want to pass all postgres arguments in the dsn (in OPAL - the url is the dsn),
    one can also use this dict to pass specific arguments.
    """
    database: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="the database name")
    user: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="user name used to authenticate")
    password: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="password used to authenticate")
    host: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="database host address (defaults to UNIX socket if not provided)")
    port: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="connection port number (defaults to 5432 if not provided)")


class PostgresFetcherConfig(FetcherConfig):
    """
    Config for PostgresFetchProvider, instance of `FetcherConfig`.

    When an OPAL client receives an update, it contains a list of `DataSourceEntry` objects.
    Each `DataSourceEntry` has a `config` key - which is usually an instance of a subclass of `FetcherConfig`.

    When writing a custom provider, you must:
    - derive your class (inherit) from FetcherConfig
    - override the `fetcher` key with your fetcher class name
    - (optional): add any fields relevant to a data entry of your fetcher.
        - In this example: since we pull data from PostgreSQL - we added a `query` key to hold the SQL query.
    """
    fetcher: str = "PostgresFetchProvider"
    connection_params: Optional[PostgresConnectionParams] = Field(None, description="these params can override or complement parts of the dsn (connection string)")
    query: str = Field(..., description="the query to run against postgres in order to fetch the data")
    fetch_one: bool = Field(False, description="whether we fetch only one row from the results of the SELECT query")
```

- The `PostgresConnectionParams` class is simply a sub-model of the main pydantic model. you might not need such a structure in your own implementation.
- The `PostgresFetcherConfig` is our actual fetcher config class:
  - The `fetcher` attribute is **mandatory**. It must include the name of your fetch-provider class. This is the value that must be later included in your DataSourceEntry objects in order to indicate which fetcher must be used. You can forget about it now, we will explain more when we get to the [Using a custom fetch provider](#using-providers) section.
  - The other attributes are specific to your fetcher. For example, in the postgres fetcher, the `query` attribute contains the [SQL SELECT query](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html) that the fetcher should run against postgres to fetch the data.

Your `FetchEvent` derived class is more straightforward, simply:

- Rename the event class to whatever you want.
- Set the value of the `fetcher` key to be your custom provider class name.
- Set the type of the `config` key to be your custom config class.

```python
class PostgresFetchEvent(FetchEvent):
    fetcher: str = "PostgresFetchProvider"
    config: PostgresFetcherConfig = None
```

### Step 4 - implementing your FetchProvider class

Your fetch provider class implements the actual logic that is needed to fetch a `DataSourceEntry` object.

The structure of the provider class is as follows:

```python
class PostgresFetchProvider(BaseFetchProvider):
    """
    The fetch-provider logic, must inherit from `BaseFetchProvider`.
    """
    ...

    def __init__(self, event: PostgresFetchEvent) -> None:
        """
        inits your provider class
        """

    def parse_event(self, event: FetchEvent) -> PostgresFetchEvent:
        """
        deserializes the fetch event type from the general `FetchEvent` to your derived fetch event (i.e: `PostgresFetchEvent`)
        """

    # if you require context to cleanup or guard resources, you can use __aenter__() and __aexit__()
    async def __aenter__(self): ...
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type=None, exc_val=None, tb=None): ...

    async def _fetch_(self):
        """
        the actual logic that you need to implement to fetch the `DataSourceEntry`.
        Can reference your (derived) `FetcherConfig` object to access your fetcher attributes.
        """

    async def _process_(self, data):
        """
        optional processing of the data returned by _fetch_().
        must return a jsonable python object (i.e: an object that can be dumped to json,
        e.g: a list or a dict that contains only serializable objects).
        """
```

Let's reimplement the [postgres provider](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/opal_fetcher_postgres/provider.py#L61) step-by-step.

#### The constructor

The constructor must be initializd with the specific FetchEvent type you defined in the previous step, and should be propagated with `super()`. You may also initialize class members.

```python
def __init__(self, event: PostgresFetchEvent) -> None:
    ...
    super().__init__(event)
    self._connection: Optional[asyncpg.Connection] = None
    self._transaction: Optional[Transaction] = None
```

The `super()` method store the event in `self._event`, and your fetcher configuration can be accessed in `self._event.config`.

#### The parse_event() method

Simply replace the custom FetchEvent type (in this example `PostgresFetchEvent`) with your own custom type. This method simply deserializes the event object from the generic `FetchEvent` type into the more specific custom event type (i.e: `PostgresFetchEvent`).

```python
def parse_event(self, event: FetchEvent) -> PostgresFetchEvent:
    return PostgresFetchEvent(**event.dict(exclude={"config"}), config=event.config)
```

#### Manage a context with `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`

Your fetch provider should typically access the network or disk and be I/O-bound, therefore it is best to use `asyncio` and typical best practices for writing async python code. That includes:

- Preferring `asyncio`-ready libraries instead of blocking libraries to fetch the data.
  - For example in our postgres provider, we use `asyncpg` instead of the blocking `psycopg2`.
- Using `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` if you need to cleanup resources or guard a context.
  - See more info on async context managers [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-context-managers).

`__aenter__` should be typically be used to initialize a connection, create a transcation, etc.

In our postgres example you can see that we connect to the database and start a transaction inside `__aenter__`. Notice that the transaction itself is an async context manager so we await its own `__aenter__`:

```python
async def __aenter__(self):
    # initializing parameters from the event/config
    self._event: PostgresFetchEvent
    dsn: str = self._event.url
    connection_params: dict = {} if self._event.config.connection_params is None else self._event.config.connection_params.dict(exclude_none=True)

    # connect to the postgres database
    self._connection: asyncpg.Connection = await asyncpg.connect(dsn, **connection_params)

    # start a readonly transaction (we don't want OPAL client writing data due to security!)
    self._transaction: Transaction = self._connection.transaction(readonly=True)
    await self._transaction.__aenter__()

    return self
```

Similarly `__aexit__` should be typically be used to free resources that were allocated inside `__aenter__`.

In our postgres example:

```python
async def __aexit__(self, exc_type=None, exc_val=None, tb=None):
    # End the transaction
    if self._transaction is not None:
        await self._transaction.__aexit__(exc_type, exc_val, tb)
    # Close the connection
    if self._connection is not None:
        await self._connection.close()
```

#### Implementing `_fetch_` and `_process_`

Providers implement a `_fetch_()` method to access and fetch data from the data-source. They also optionally implement a `_process_()` method to mutate the data before returning it (for example converting a JSON string to an actual object).

The `_fetch_()` and `_process_()` method can access the fields available from `self._event` (the [FetchEvent](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/events.py#L12)):

- The url we should fetch data from is available at `self._event.url`.
- The custom `FetcherConfig` (custom configuration) is available at `self._event.config`.

In our own example provider `_fetch_()` simply runs the SQL query and returns the results:

```python
async def _fetch_(self):
    self._event: PostgresFetchEvent # type casting

    # ...
    # there was more code here, it's not very interesting for the tutorial ;)
    # ...

    if self._event.config.fetch_one:
        row = await self._connection.fetchrow(self._event.config.query)
        return [row]
    else:
        return await self._connection.fetch(self._event.config.query)
```

Since asyncpg returns a list of `asyncpg.Record` objects, we must process them in `_process_` and turn them into something jsonable (the reason is that we currently only support OPA as a policy store, and OPA can only store JSON).

Our `_process_()` method takes care of the conversion:

```python
async def _process_(self, records: List[asyncpg.Record]):
    self._event: PostgresFetchEvent # type casting

    # when fetch_one is true, we want to return a dict (and not a list)
    if self._event.config.fetch_one:
        if records:
            # we transform the asyncpg record to a dict that we can be later serialized to json
            return dict(records[0])
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        # we transform the asyncpg records to a list-of-dicts that we can be later serialized to json
        return [dict(record) for record in records]
```

#### Bonus: How the process of calling your fetch provider works:

- The fetch provider is called by the [FetchingEngine](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/engine/fetching_engine.py)'s `fetch_worker`.
- The [fetch_worker](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/engine/fetch_worker.py#L33-L34) invokes a provider's `.fetch()` and `.process()` methods which are simply proxies to its `_fetch_()` and `_process_()` methods.
- The [fetcher-register](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/fetcher_register.py) loads the providers when OPAL client first loads and makes them available for fetch-workers.


### Step 5 - testing locally your fetch provider

  When you write a fetch provider, you will want to test it locally before publishing it to PyPI. Here's how you can do it:

  You can use the `-e` or `--editable` argument for pip to install your package without building it, letting you use the source code directly, and modify it etc.

  ```bash
  pip install -e path/to/your/package
  ```

  [More info on the `--editable` flag](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-e)

  There are two main ways to test your fetch provider:

  1. **Run the OPAL Client locally** instead of inside a Docker container using the command:

  ```bash
  opal-client run
  ```

  or using `uvicorn` directly:

  ```bash
  uvicorn opal_client.main:app
  ```

  This is the easiest way to debug and test your fetch provider.

  2. **Install the custom package inside the Docker container**. You can use `pip install -e` inside the Docker container, then mount the source code at the install directory. This way you can modify it and run it without needing to rebuild the package or the Docker container.

  Here's how you can do it:

  - Create a custom OPAL Client docker image.
  - Install the custom package using `pip install -e /custom-package`.
  - Run a container with the source code mounted at `/custom-package`.

  With this setup you can connect a remote debugger to the live Docker container, and run everything inside there.

  If you are using PyCharm, here's a guide for that: [Using Docker as a remote interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html).






## <a name="using-providers"></a>Using a custom fetch provider

This section explains how to use a custom OPAL fetch provider in your OPAL setup.

### Before we begin - How does OPAL find custom fetch providers?

As mentioned before, all FetchProviders are simply python classes that derive (inherit) from [BaseFetchProvider](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/fetch_provider.py#L9). OPAL searches for fetch providers based on the env var `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES`, defined [here](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/config.py#L36).

For example, if the env var is:

```
OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES=opal_common.fetcher.providers,opal_fetcher_postgres.provider
```

OPAL will parse this var as a comma-separated list, and for each item in the list OPAL will find that python module, import it and then look inside the imported module for subclasses of `BaseFetchProvider`.

In our example, OPAL will import two python modules:

1. `opal_common.fetcher.providers`: there's a trick in the [\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/fetcher/providers/__init__.py) file of the module that causes all classes in the directory to be added to `__all__` and thus to be available directly under the module. Since both `HttpFetchProvider` and `FastApiRpcFetchProvider` inherit from `BaseFetchProvider` - both of them will be found by OPAL and added to the fetcher register.
2. `opal_fetcher_postgres.provider`: no special tricks here. if you look inside [that module](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/opal_fetcher_postgres/provider.py), you will see that the class `PostgresFetchProvider` inherits from `BaseFetchProvider`.

### 1) Create a custom docker image containing your fetch provider

In the [official docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/permitio/opal-client) of OPAL, **no custom providers are installed**. In order for OPAL to be able to load a custom provider's python module, the python module need to be available on the docker image.

Therefore the first step is to create and build a custom OPAL-client `Dockerfile`.

Example `Dockerfile` (taken from the [example fetcher repo](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres)) - of a non-published python package:

```Dockerfile
# inherits all behavior defined in the official OPAL-client image
FROM permitio/opal-client:latest
WORKDIR /app/
# These two commands installs the python package from source
COPY . ./
RUN python setup.py install
```

If your custom provider is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (assuming its name is `opal-fetcher-postgres`), the docker image can be even simpler:

```Dockerfile
# inherits all behavior defined in the official OPAL-client image
FROM permitio/opal-client:latest
# installs the python package inside the container (from pip / PyPI)
RUN pip install --user opal-fetcher-postgres
```

### 2) Build your custom opal-client container

Say your special Dockerfile from step one is called `custom_client.Dockerfile`.

You must build a customized OPAL container from this Dockerfile, like so:

```
docker build -t yourcompany/opal-client -f custom_client.Dockerfile .
```

### 3) When running OPAL, set `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES`

Pass a customized `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES` env var to the OPAL client docker container (comma-separated provider modules):

```
OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES=opal_common.fetcher.providers,opal_fetcher_postgres.provider
```

Notice that OPAL receives a list from where to search for fetch providers.
The list in our case includes the built-in providers (`opal_common.fetcher.providers`) as well as our custom postgres provider. Naturally, replace `opal_fetcher_postgres.provider` with your own custom provider if needed.

### 4) Using the custom provider in your DataSourceEntry objects

Fetchers are triggered when OPAL client is instructed to fetch **Data Source Entries**. Each entry is a directive what data to fetch, from where, how it should be fetched and how it should be saved into the policy store (i.e: OPA).

Your [DataSourceEntry](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-common/opal_common/schemas/data.py#L9) objects can be used either in `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES` as initial data sources fetched when OPAL client first loads, or in dynamic (realtime) updates sent via the [OPAL publish API](http://localhost:7002/docs#/Data%20Updates/publish_data_update_event_data_config_post). There's a guide on hwo to trigger data updates [here](trigger_data_updates).

Each DataSourceEntry object has a `config` attribute which is a dict that matches the schema of `FetcherConfig`.

The dict included in `config` should contain:

- **A `fetcher` attribute** that indicates to OPAL that a custom provider should be used to fetch that `DataSourceEntry`. The `fetcher` attribute should contain the name of the custom FetchProvider class (the class that derives from `BaseFetchProvider`).
- Any **custom attributes** that your fetcher config type declares (the python class defined in your fetch-provider module that inherits from `FetcherConfig`). See how to write a custom config in the [writing providers section](#writing-providers) above.

Example value of `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES` (formatted nicely, but in env var you should pack this to one-line and no-spaces):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "url": "postgresql://postgres@example_db:5432/postgres",
        "config": {
          "fetcher": "PostgresFetchProvider",
          "query": "SELECT * from city;",
          "connection_params": {
            "password": "postgres"
          }
        },
        "topics": ["policy_data"],
        "dst_path": "cities"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the example `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES` we just shown:

- The `fetcher` attributes indicates that in order to fetch the entry, the provider `PostgresFetchProvider` must be used.
- The `query` and `connection_params` attributes are specific to the `PostgresFetchProvider` provider, and are defined by the config type `PostgresFetcherConfig`.

### Wrapping this up - check out a docker compose example

This [docker compose](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file contains:

- **A custom opal client** based on [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres/blob/master/Dockerfile). Only difference is that we install the custom fetch-provider python module into the container.
- **The configuration** necessary to use the custom fetch provider:
  - `OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES` is defined for the OPAL-client and tells OPAL to load `opal_fetcher_postgres.provider` to the fetcher register.
  - `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES` is defined for the OPAL-server with a DataSourceEntry that contains a `fetcher` override. The value of the `fetcher` key tell OPAL to use `PostgresFetchProvider` to fetch the entry.

you may run this compose file by cloning the [example repo](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres) and running

```
docker compose up
```
