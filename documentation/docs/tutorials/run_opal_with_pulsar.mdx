# Running OPAL-server with Apache Pulsar

## Introduction

OPAL-server supports multiple backbone pub/sub solutions for connecting distributed server instances. This guide explains how to set up and use Apache Pulsar as the backbone pub/sub (broadcast channel) for OPAL-server.

## Apache Pulsar as the Backbone Pub/Sub

### What is a backbone pub/sub?

OPAL-server can scale out both in number of worker processes per server and across multiple servers. While OPAL provides a lightweight websocket pub/sub for OPAL-clients, multiple servers are linked together by a more robust messaging solution like Apache Pulsar, Kafka, Redis, or Postgres Listen/Notify.

### Broadcaster Module

Support for multiple backbone solutions is provided by the Permit's port of the [Python Broadcaster package](https://pypi.org/project/permit-broadcaster/). To use it with Apache Pulsar, install the `permit-broadcaster[pulsar]` module:

```bash
pip install permit-broadcaster[pulsar]
```

## Setting Up OPAL-server with Apache Pulsar

### Configuration

To use Apache Pulsar as the backbone, set the `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` environment variable:

```bash
OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=pulsar://pulsar-host-name:6650
```

The "pulsar://" prefix tells OPAL-server to use Apache Pulsar.

### Pulsar Topic

OPAL-server uses a single Pulsar topic named 'broadcast' for all communication. This topic is automatically created when the producer and consumer are initialized.

## Docker Compose Example

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` configuration that includes Apache Pulsar:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  pulsar:
    image: apachepulsar/pulsar:3.3.1
    command: bin/pulsar standalone
    ports:
      - 6650:6650
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - pulsardata:/pulsar/data
      - pulsarconf:/pulsar/conf

  opal-server:
    image: permitio/opal-server:latest
    environment:
      - OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=pulsar://pulsar:6650
    depends_on:
      - pulsar

volumes:
  pulsardata:
  pulsarconf:
```

Run this configuration with:

```bash
docker compose up --force-recreate
```

Allow a few seconds for Apache Pulsar and OPAL to start up before testing connectivity.

## Triggering Events

You can trigger events using the OPAL CLI:

```bash
opal-client publish-data-update --src-url https://api.country.is/23.54.6.78 -t policy_data --dst-path /users/bob/location
```

You should see the effect in:
- OPAL-server logs: "Broadcasting incoming event"
- OPAL-client: Receiving and acting on the event
- Pulsar: Event data in the 'broadcast' topic

## Supported Backends

| Backend  | Environment Variable                                   | Docker Compose Service |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Kafka    | `BROADCAST_URL=kafka://localhost:9092`                  | `docker compose up kafka` |
| Redis    | `BROADCAST_URL=redis://localhost:6379`                  | `docker compose up redis` |
| Postgres | `BROADCAST_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/broadcaster`   | `docker compose up postgres` |
| Pulsar   | `BROADCAST_URL=pulsar://localhost:6650`                 | `docker compose up pulsar` |

## Advanced: Publishing Events Directly to Pulsar

You can trigger events by publishing messages directly to the 'broadcast' topic in Pulsar. Ensure the message format follows the OPAL-server schema for backbone events.

## Conclusion

This guide covered setting up and using Apache Pulsar as the backbone pub/sub for OPAL-server. By following these instructions, you can effectively scale your OPAL deployment across multiple servers.
