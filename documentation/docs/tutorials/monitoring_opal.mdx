# Monitoring OPAL

There are multiple ways you can monitor your OPAL deployment:

- **Logs** - Using the structured logs outputted to stderr by both the OPAL-servers and OPAL-clients
- **Health-checks** - OPAL exposes HTTP health check endpoints ([See below](##health-checks))
- [**Callbacks**](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks#-data-update-callbacks) - Using the callback webhooks feature - having OPAL-clients report their updates
- **Statistics** - Using the built-in statistics feature in OPAL ([See below](##opal-statistics))
- **OpenTelemetry Metrics and Tracing** - OPAL can expose metrics and tracing information using OpenTelemetry for monitoring ([See below](#opentelemetry-metrics-and-tracing)).

## Health checks

### OPAL Server

opal-server exposes http health check endpoints on `/` & `/healthcheck`. <br/>
Currently it returns `200 OK` as long as server is up.

### OPAL Client

opal-client exposes 2 types of http health checks:

- **Readiness** - available on `/ready`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the client have loaded policy & data to OPA at least once (from either server, or local backup file), otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned.

- **Liveness** - available on `/`, `/healthcheck` & `/healthy`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the last attempts to load policy & data to OPA were successful, otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned

**Notice:** if you don't except your opal-client to load any data into OPA, set `OPAL_DATA_UPDATER_ENABLED: False`, so opal-client could report being healthy.

You can also configure opal-client to store dynamic health status as a document in OPA, [Learn more here](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks)

## OPAL Statistics

By enabling `OPAL_STATISTICS_ENABLED=true` (on both servers and clients), the OPAL-Server would start maintaining a unified state of all the clients and which topics they've subscribed to.
The state can then be retrieved as a JSON object by calling the `/statistics` api route on the server

### Code Reference:

- [opal_server/statistics.py](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-server/opal_server/statistics.py)


## OPAL Client tracker (EAP)

Alternative implementation for the Statistics feature, OPAL-Server tracks all OPAL-clients connected through websocket.
Gathered information includes connection details (client's source host and port), connection time, and subscribed topics.
Available through `/pubsub_client_info` api route on the server.

### Caveats:
- When `UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS > 1`, retrieved information would only include clients connected to the replying server process.
- This is an early access feature and is likely to change. Backward compatibility is not garaunteed.

## OpenTelemetry Metrics and Tracing

OPAL supports exporting metrics and tracing information using OpenTelemetry, which can be integrated with various monitoring and observability tools.

### Enabling OpenTelemetry Metrics and Tracing

To enable OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing, you need to set the following environment variables in both OPAL server and OPAL client:

```
OPAL_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY_TRACING=true
OPAL_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY_METRICS=true
OPAL_OPENTELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<your-otel-collector-endpoint>
```

- OPAL_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY_TRACING: Set to `true` to enable tracing.
- OPAL_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY_METRICS: Set to `true` to enable metrics.
- OPAL_OPENTELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT: Set the endpoint for the OpenTelemetry Collector

### Exposing Metrics and Traces

- Both the server and client will expose a `/metrics` endpoint that returns metrics in Prometheus format.
- Traces are exported to the configured OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint using OTLP over gRPC.

### Available Metrics and Traces

Below is a list of the available metrics and traces in OPAL, along with their types, available tags (attributes), and explanations.

#### OPAL Server Metrics and Traces

##### 1) `opal_server_data_update`
- **Type**: Trace
- **Description**: Represents a data update operation in the OPAL server. This trace spans the process of publishing data updates to clients.
- **Attributes**:
  - `topics_count`: Number of topics involved in the data update.
  - `entries_count`: Number of data update entries.
  - Additional attributes related to errors or execution time.

##### 2) `opal_server_policy_update`
- **Type**: Trace
- **Description**: Represents a policy update operation in the OPAL server. This trace spans the process of checking for policy changes and notifying clients.
- **Attributes**:
  - Information about the policy repository, such as commit hashes.
  - Errors encountered during the update process.

##### 3) `opal_server_policy_bundle_request`
- **Type**: Trace
- **Description**: Represents a request for a policy bundle from a client. This trace spans the process of generating and serving the policy bundle to the client.
- **Attributes**:
  - `bundle.type`: The type of bundle (full or diff).
  - `bundle.size`: The size of the bundle in number of files or bytes.
  - `scope_id`: The scope identifier if scopes are used.

##### 4) `opal_server_policy_bundle_size`
- **Type**: Metric (Histogram)
- **Unit**: Files
- **Description**: Records the size of the policy bundles served by the OPAL server. The size is measured in the number of files included in the bundle.
- **Attributes**:
  - `type`: The type of bundle (full or diff).

##### 5) `opal_server_active_clients`
- **Type**: Metric (UpDownCounter)
- **Description**: Tracks the number of active clients connected to the OPAL server.
- **Attributes**:
  - `client_id`: The unique identifier of the client.
  - `source`: The source host and port of the client (e.g., 192.168.1.10:34567).

#### OPAL Client Metrics and Traces

##### 1) `opal_client_data_subscriptions`
- **Type**: Metric (UpDownCounter)
- **Description**: Tracks the number of data subscriptions per client.
- **Attributes**:
  - `client_id`: The unique identifier of the client.
  - `topic`: The topic to which the client is subscribed.

##### 2) `opal_client_data_update_trigger`
- **Type**: Trace
- **Description**: Represents the operation of triggering a data update via the API in the OPAL client.
- **Attributes**:
  - `source`: The source of the trigger (e.g., API).
  - Errors encountered during the trigger.

##### 3) `opal_client_data_update_apply`
- **Type**: Trace

- **Attributes**:
  - Execution time.
  - Errors encountered during the update.

##### 4) `opal_client_policy_update_apply`
- **Type**: Trace
- **Description**: Represents the application of a policy update within the OPAL client. This trace spans the process of fetching and applying policy updates from the server.
- **Attributes**:
  - Execution time.
  - Errors encountered during the update.

##### 5) `opal_client_policy_store_status`
- **Type**: Metric (Observable Gauge)
- **Description**: Indicates the current status of the policy store's authentication type used by the OPAL client.
- **Attributes**:
  - `auth_type`: The authentication type configured for the policy store (e.g., TOKEN, OAUTH, NONE).
  - **Value**: The metric has a value of 1 when the policy store is active with the specified authentication type.

### Example

To monitor OPAL using Prometheus and Grafana, a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration is provided in the root directory of the repository under docker. The file is named docker-compose-with-prometheus-and-otel.yml.

Run the following command to start Prometheus and Grafana:

```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-with-prometheus-and-otel.yml up
```

This setup will start Prometheus to scrape metrics from OPAL server and client, and Grafana to visualize the metrics.
