# Monitoring OPAL

There are multiple ways you can monitor your OPAL deployment:

- **Logs** - Using the structured logs outputted to stderr by both the OPAL-servers and OPAL-clients
- **Health-checks** - OPAL exposes HTTP health check endpoints ([See below](##health-checks))
- [**Callbacks**](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks#-data-update-callbacks) - Using the callback webhooks feature - having OPAL-clients report their updates
- **Statistics** - Using the built-in statistics feature in OPAL ([See below](##opal-statistics))
- **DataDog APM** - OPAL supports DataDog APM tracing (requires ddtrace v3.0.0+ and Python 3.8+)

## Health checks

### OPAL Server

opal-server exposes http health check endpoints on `/` & `/healthcheck`. <br/>
Currently it returns `200 OK` as long as server is up.

### OPAL Client

opal-client exposes 2 types of http health checks:

- **Readiness** - available on `/ready`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the client have loaded policy & data to OPA at least once (from either server, or local backup file), otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned.

- **Liveness** - available on `/`, `/healthcheck` & `/healthy`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the last attempts to load policy & data to OPA were successful, otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned

**Notice:** if you don't except your opal-client to load any data into OPA, set `OPAL_DATA_UPDATER_ENABLED: False`, so opal-client could report being healthy.

You can also configure opal-client to store dynamic health status as a document in OPA, [Learn more here](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks)

## OPAL Statistics

By enabling `OPAL_STATISTICS_ENABLED=true` (on both servers and clients), the OPAL-Server would start maintaining a unified state of all the clients and which topics they've subscribed to.
The state can then be retrieved as a JSON object by calling the `/statistics` api route on the server

### Code Reference:

- [opal_server/statistics.py](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-server/opal_server/statistics.py)

## DataDog APM Monitoring

OPAL supports DataDog APM (Application Performance Monitoring) for observing your OPAL deployment's performance and traces.

### Requirements

- **ddtrace v3.0.0 or higher** - OPAL has been upgraded to use the latest ddtrace version
- **Python 3.8 or higher** - ddtrace v3.0.0+ dropped support for Python 3.7

### Configuration

To enable DataDog APM monitoring:

1. Set the `ENABLE_DATADOG_APM=true` environment variable for both OPAL server and client
2. (Optional) To disable APM when needed, set `DD_TRACE_ENABLED=false`

### Breaking Changes in ddtrace v3.0.0

The following changes were made to support ddtrace v3.0.0:

- The `ddtrace.filters.TraceFilter` import has been moved to `ddtrace.trace.TraceFilter`
- Programmatic APM disabling via `tracer.configure(enabled=False)` is no longer supported
- APM should now be disabled using the `DD_TRACE_ENABLED=false` environment variable

For more information about ddtrace v3.0.0 changes, see the [official migration guide](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/releases/tag/v3.0.0).


## OPAL Client tracker (EAP)

Alternative implementation for the Statistics feature, OPAL-Server tracks all OPAL-clients connected through websocket.
Gathered information includes connection details (client's source host and port), connection time, and subscribed topics.
Available through `/pubsub_client_info` api route on the server.

### Caveats:
- When `UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS > 1`, retrieved information would only include clients connected to the replying server process.
- This is an early access feature and is likely to change. Backward compatibility is not garaunteed.
