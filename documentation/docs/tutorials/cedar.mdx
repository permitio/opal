# Cedar-Agent and Cedar

Cedar is an open-source engine and language created by AWS.
[Cedar agent](https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent) is an OSS project from Permit.io - which provides the ability to run Cedar as a standalone agent (Similar to how one would use OPA) which can then be powered by [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal).
Cedar agent is the easiest way to deploy and run Cedar.

:::info Demo
Check out our [demo app that uses Cedar-Agent and OPAL here](https://github.com/permitio/tinytodo).
:::

OPAL can run Cedar instead of OPA. To launch an example configuration with Docker Compose, do:
```
git clone https://github.com/permitio/opal.git
cd opal
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-example-cedar.yml up -d
```

You'll then have Cedar's dev web interface at [http://localhost:8180/rapidoc/](http://localhost:8180/rapidoc/), where you can call Cedar-Agent's API routes.

You can show data with GET on **/data**, policy with GET on **/policies**, and you can POST the following authorization to **/is_authorized** request to perform an authorization check:
```
{
  "principal": "User::\"someone@permit.io\"",
  "action": "Action::\"document:write\"",
  "resource": "ResourceType::\"document\""
}
```

To show how the policy affects the request, set a policy with fewer permissions with a PUT on **/policies**:
```
[
  {
    "id": "policy.cedar",
    "content": "permit(\n  principal in Role::\"Editor\",\n  action in [Action::\"document:read\",Action::\"document:delete\"],\n  resource in ResourceType::\"document\"\n) when {\n  true\n};"
  }
]
```
Then restore the correct policy:
```
[
  {
    "id": "policy.cedar",
    "content": "permit(\n  principal in Role::\"Editor\",\n  action in [Action::\"document:read\",Action::\"document:write\",Action::\"document:delete\"],\n  resource in ResourceType::\"document\"\n) when {\n  true\n};"
  }
]
```
Alternatively, you can also change the Docker compose config and set your own policy git repo (the **OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL** variable), and change it on the fly.


If you want to see OPAL's logs, you can do:
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-example-cedar.yml logs opal_server
```
and
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-example-cedar.yml logs opal_client
```
For the server and client, respectively.
