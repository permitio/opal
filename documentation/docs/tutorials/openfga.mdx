# OpenFGA and OPAL

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open-source [Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga) engine implementing the [Zanzibar authorization model created by Google](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-google-zanzibar). OPAL provides realtime synchronization and management capabilities for OpenFGA, helping you keep your authorization data and relationships up-to-date across distributed OpenFGA instances.

## Why Use OPAL with OpenFGA?

While OpenFGA provides powerful authorization capabilities on its own, managing authorization at scale across distributed environments presents several challenges:

- **Consistency**: Keeping authorization models and relationship data synchronized across multiple instances
- **Data Sync**: Integrating authorization data from various sources and systems
- **Deployment**: Managing updates and changes across distributed OpenFGA deployments
- **Monitoring**: Tracking the health and status of your authorization infrastructure

OPAL solves these challenges by providing a centralized management layer that handles synchronization, data integration, and monitoring.

## Key Features

By integrating OpenFGA with OPAL, you get:

- **Real-time Authorization Model Updates**:
  - Automatically synchronize authorization models across multiple OpenFGA instances
  - Push model changes instantly through OPAL's pub/sub system
  - Version control your authorization models through Git

- **Distributed Deployment Support**:
  - Scale authorization across multiple regions/clusters while maintaining consistency
  - Each OPAL client can manage its own OpenFGA instance
  - Central management through OPAL server reduces operational complexity
  - Support for blue/green deployments and gradual rollouts

- **Data Source Integration**:
  - Pull relationship data from multiple sources:
    - REST APIs
    - Databases
    - Message queues
    - Custom data sources [via OPAL fetchers](https://opal.ac/fetch-providers)
  - Keep relationship tuples synchronized in real-time
  - Transform data automatically to OpenFGA format

- **Git Integration**:
  - Store authorization models in version control
  - Track changes and rollback when needed
  - Use Git workflows for authorization model updates
  - Support for multiple branches and environments

- **Health Monitoring**:
  - Built-in health checks for OpenFGA instances
  - Monitor synchronization status
  - Track authorization model updates
  - Alert on issues or inconsistencies

- **Transaction Tracking**:
  - Detailed logging of all model changes
  - Audit trail for authorization updates
  - Performance metrics and analytics

## Quick Start

1. Run OpenFGA with OPAL using docker-compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/permitio/opal.git
cd opal
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-example-openfga.yml up -d

or

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/permitio/opal/master/docker/docker-compose-example-openfga.yml -o docker-compose-example-openfga.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose-example-openfga.yml up -d
```

This will start:

- OpenFGA server on port 8080
- OPAL server on port 7002
- OPAL client configured for OpenFGA

2. Verify the setup:

```bash
# Check OPAL server health
curl http://localhost:7002/healthcheck

# Check OpenFGA API
curl http://localhost:8080/stores

# Check OPAL client health
curl http://localhost:7000/healthcheck
```

Common setup issues:
- If services don't start, check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Ensure ports 7000, 7002, and 8080 are available
- Verify network connectivity between containers

## Writing OpenFGA Authorization Models

OPAL can track your authorization models directly from Git. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create an authorization model repository with this structure:
```
.
├── authorization_model.json   # Main authorization model
├── relationships/            # Relationship data
│   ├── defaults.json
│   └── seed_data.json
└── .manifest                 # OPAL manifest file
```

2. Define your authorization model in `authorization_model.json` or `authorization_model.yaml`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.1",
  "type_definitions": [
    {
      "type": "user"
    },
    {
      "type": "document",
      "relations": {
        "viewer": {
          "union": {
            "child": [
              {"this": {}},
              {
                "computedUserset": {
                  "relation": "owner"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "owner": {
          "this": {}
        }
      },
      "metadata": {
        "relations": {
          "viewer": {
            "directly_related_user_types": [
              { "type": "user" }
            ]
          },
          "owner": {
            "directly_related_user_types": [
              { "type": "user" }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using yaml format
```yaml
schema_version: "1.1"
type_definitions:
  - type: user
  - type: document
    relations:
      viewer:
        union:
          child:
            - this: {}
            - computedUserset:
                relation: owner
      owner:
        this: {}
    metadata:
      relations:
        viewer:
          directly_related_user_types:
            - type: user
        owner:
          directly_related_user_types:
            - type: user
```


3. Configure OPAL to track your repository by setting these environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/daveads/opal-example-policy-openfga
  - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_MAIN_BRANCH=main
  - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL=30
```

Best practices:
- Use separate branches for development and production
- Include clear documentation in your model files
- Follow a consistent naming convention for types and relations
- Use OPAL's manifest file to control loading order

## Using Data Fetchers

OPAL can fetch relationship tuples from external sources and keep them synchronized with OpenFGA. Here's an example using the HTTP fetcher:

1. Configure data sources in OPAL server's `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES`:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/policy-data",
        "topics": ["policy_data"],
        "config": {
          "fetcher": "HttpFetchProvider",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
          },
          "method": "GET"
        },
        "dst_path": "/static"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Ensure your API returns data in OpenFGA tuple format:

```json
{
  "tuples": [
    {
      "user": "user:anne",
      "relation": "viewer",
      "object": "document:budget"
    },
    {
      "user": "user:bob",
      "relation": "owner",
      "object": "document:roadmap"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Handle errors and data validation:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/policy-data",
        "topics": ["policy-data"],
        "config": {
          "fetcher": "HttpFetchProvider",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
          },
          "method": "GET",
          "retry": {
            "max_attempts": 3,
            "backoff_seconds": 1
          },
          "validate_schema": true
        },
        "dst_path": "/static"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Running OpenFGA with OPAL

Once your configuration is ready, you can manage OpenFGA through OPAL:

1. **Initialize the Store**:
```bash
# Create a new store
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

2. **Apply Authorization Model**:
```bash
# OPAL will automatically sync your model from Git
# Verify it was applied:
curl http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/authorization-models
```

3. **Write Relationship Tuples**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/write \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "writes": {
    "tuple_keys": [
      {
        "user": "user:anne",
        "relation": "viewer",
        "object": "document:budget"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

4. **Check Permissions**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/check \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "tuple_key": {
    "user": "user:anne",
    "relation": "viewer",
    "object": "document:budget"
  }
}'
```
