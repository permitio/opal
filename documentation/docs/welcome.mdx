## **Open Policy Administration Layer**

OPAL is an administration layer for Policy Engines such as [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org),
and [AWS' Cedar Agent](https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent). OPAL detects changes to both policy and policy data in realtime, and pushes live
updates to your agents - briging open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications.

As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services),
OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need.

### Getting Started

OPAL is available both as python packages with a built-in CLI as well as pre-built docker images.

- **[Try the OPAL live playground environment in docker-compose](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/quickstart/opal-playground/overview/)**
- **[Getting Started Guide for Containers](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/overview/)**
- **[OPAL Kubernetes Helm Chart](https://github.com/permitio/opal-helm-chart)**
- An in-depth introduction to OPAL **[is available here](https://www.permit.io/blog/introduction-to-opal)**.
