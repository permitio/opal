# OPAL Scopes

OPAL Scopes allows OPAL to serve different policies and data sources,
serving them to multiple clients. Every scope contains its own policy and
data sources. All clients using the same Scope ID will get the same policy
and data.

Scopes are an easy way to use OPAL with multiple Git repositories
(or other sources of policy), and are a core feature to enable using
OPAL itself as a multi-tenant service.

Scopes are dynamic, and can be created on the fly through the scopes
API (`/scopes`)

## Setting up scopes

> #### Prerequisites
>
> Scopes are supported in OPAL 0.2.0 and above. Use the
> [provided docker compose example](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-scopes-example.yml)
> to quickly get started.
>
> The server must be started with the environment variable
> `OPAL_SCOPES=1`.

### Use a REST API call to create or change a scope

In this scenario, we create two different scopes (_internal_ and _external_),
that, for example, can be used for an internal and external facing app.
The _internal_ scope uses policies located in the _internal_ directory,
and _external_ uses policies defined in the external directory. We can set
different directories, different branches, different repositories, and any
other setting.

The authorization used in this example are GitHub Personal Access Tokens that
can be [generated here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

```bash
curl --request PUT 'http://opal_server/scopes'
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--header 'Authorization: $OPAL_TOKEN'
--data-raw '{
  "scope_id": "internal",
  "policy": {
    "source_type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/company/policy",
    "auth": {
      "auth_type": "github_token",
      "token": "github_token"
    },
    "directories": [
      "internal"
    ],
    "extensions": [
      ".rego",
      ".json"
    ],
    "manifest": ".manifest",
    "poll_updates": true,
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "data": {
    "entries": []
  }
}'
```

```bash
curl --request PUT 'http://opal_server/scopes'
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--header 'Authorization: $OPAL_TOKEN'
--data-raw '{
  "scope_id": "external",
  "policy": {
    "source_type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/company/policy",
    "auth": {
      "auth_type": "github_token",
      "token": "github_token"
    },
    "directories": [
      "external"
    ],
    "extensions": [
      ".rego",
      ".json"
    ],
    "manifest": ".manifest",
    "poll_updates": true,
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "data": {
    "entries": []
  }
}'
```

### Launch OPAL Client with a scope

```bash
docker run -it \
  --env OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN \
  --env OPAL_SERVER_URL \
  --env OPAL_DATA_TOPICS \
  --env OPAL_SCOPE_ID=internal \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  permitio/opal-client
```
