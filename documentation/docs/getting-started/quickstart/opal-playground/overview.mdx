# OPAL Playground

This tutorial will show you what you can do with **OPAL**, and teach you about **OPAL core features**.

We built an example configuration that you can run in **docker compose**. The example was built specifically for
you to **explore OPAL quickly**, understand the core features and see what OPAL can do for you.

You can get a running OPAL environment by running one `docker compose` command.

Let's take OPAL for a swing!
