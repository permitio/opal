# Step 1: run docker compose to start the opal server and client

Download and run a working configuration of OPAL server and OPAL client on your machine:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/permitio/opal/master/docker/docker-compose-example.yml \
> docker-compose.yml && docker-compose up
```

You can alternatively **clone the OPAL repository** and run the example compose file from your local clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/permitio/opal.git

cd opal

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-example.yml up
```

The `docker-compose.yml` we just downloaded - [view the file here](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/docker/docker-compose-example.yml) - is **running 3 containers**:

1. A **Broadcast Channel** Container
2. An **OPAL Server** Container
3. An **OPAL Client** Container

We provide a detailed review of exactly **what is running and why** later in this tutorial.
You can [jump there by clicking this link](#compose-recap) to gain a deeper understanding, and then come back here,
or you can continue with the hands-on tutorial.

**OPAL** (and also **OPA**) are now running on your machine. You should be aware of the following ports that are exposed on `localhost`:

- **OPAL Server** - PORT `:7002` - the **_OPAL client_** (and potentially the CLI) can connect to this port.
- **OPAL Client** - PORT `:7766` - the **_OPAL client_** has its own API, but it's irrelevant to this tutorial.
- **OPA** - PORT `:8181` - the port of the **_OPA Agent_** that is running **running in server mode**.

:::info
**OPA** is being **run by OPAL client** in its container as a **managed process**.
