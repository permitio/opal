# Configuring the Security Parameters

### Step 6: Server config - security parameters

In this step we show how to configure the OPAL server **security parameters**.

Declaring these parameters and passing them to OPAL server will cause the server to run in **secure mode**, which means client identity verification will be active. All the values in this section are sensitive, in production you should place them in a [secrets store](#security-considerations).

#### When should i run in secure mode?

In a dev environment, secure mode is optional and you can skip this section.

However, in production environments you **should** run in secure mode.

#### 1) Generating encryption keys

Using a utility like [ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen) we can easily generate the keys (on Windows try [SSH-keys Windows guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/generate-ssh-key-windows-10)).

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem
```

follow the instructions to save the keys to two files.

#### 2) Place encryption keys in environment variables

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Env Var Name</th>
      <th align="left">Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Content of the var is a private crypto key (i.e: SSH key)</li>
          <li>
            The private key is usually found in `id_rsa` or a similar file
          </li>
          <li>
            The passed value must be the contents of the SSH key in one line
            (replace new-line with underscore, i.e: <code>\n</code> with{" "}
            <code>_</code>)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Content of the var is a public crypto key (i.e: SSH key)</li>
          <li>
            The public key is usually found in `id_rsa.pub` or a similar file
          </li>
          <li>
            The passed value must be the contents of the SSH key in one line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usually public keys already fit into one line. If not, encoding is
            same as for the private key (replace new-line with underscore, i.e:{" "}
            <code>\n</code> with <code>_</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Example values:

If your private key looks like this (we redacted most of the key)

```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
XXX...
...
...XXX==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Declare it like this (notice how we simply replace new lines with underscores):

```
export OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----_XXX..._..._...XXX==_-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

For public keys, it should be something like this:

```
export OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=ssh-rsa XXX ... XXX== some@one.com
```

#### 3) Configuring the master token

You can choose any secret you'd like, but as we've showed you [before](#generate-secret), the OPAL CLI can be used to generate cryptographically strong secrets easily.

```
opal-server generate-secret
```

You must then configure the master token like so

| Env Var Name           | Function                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN | the master token generated by the cli (or any other secret you pick) |
