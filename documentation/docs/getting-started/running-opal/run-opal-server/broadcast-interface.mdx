# Broadcast Interface

### Step 2: Server config - broadcast interface

#### 1) Deploying the broadcast channel backbone service (optional)

When scaling the OPAL Server to **multiple workers** and/or **multiple containers**, we use a **broadcast channel** to sync between all the instances of OPAL Server. In order words, communication on the broadcast channel is **communication between OPAL servers**, and is not related to the OPAL client.

Under the hood, our interface to the broadcast channel **backbone service** is implemented by [encode/broadcaster](https://github.com/encode/broadcaster).

At the moment, the supported broadcast channel backbones are:

- Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY
- Redis
- Kafka

Deploying the actual service used for broadcast (i.e: Redis) is outside the scope of this tutorial. The easiest way is to use a managed service (e.g: AWS RDS, AWS ElastiCache, etc), but you can also deploy your own dockers.

When running in production, you **should** run with multiple workers per server instance (i.e: container/node), if not multiple containers, and thus deploying the backbone service becomes **mandatory** for production environments.

#### 2) Declaring the broadcast uri environment variable

Declaring the broadcast uri is optional, depending on whether you deployed a broadcast backbone service and are also running with more than one OPAL server instance (multiple workers or multiple nodes). If you are running with multiple server instances (you **should** for production), declaring the broadcast uri is **mandatory**.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### 3) Declaring the number of uvicorn workers

As we mentioned in the previous section, each container can run multiple workers, and if you use more than one, you need a broadcast channel.

This is how you define the number of workers (pay attention: this env var is not prefixed with `OPAL_`):

| Env Var Name        | Function                                                         |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS | the number of workers in a single container (example value: `4`) |
