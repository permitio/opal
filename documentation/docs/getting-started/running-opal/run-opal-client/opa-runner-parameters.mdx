# OPA Runner Parameters

### Step 5: Client config - OPA runner parameters (Optional)

If you are running with inline OPA (meaning OPAL client runs OPA for you in the same docker image), you can change the default parameters used to run OPA.

In order to override default configuration, you'll need to set this env var:

| Env Var Name           | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPAL_INLINE_OPA_CONFIG | The value of this var should be an [OpaServerOptions](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-client/opal_client/engine/options.py#L19) pydantic model encoded into json string. The process is similar to the one we showed on how to encode the value of [OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES](/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-server/data-sources#encoding-this-value-in-an-environment-variable). |

#### Control how OPAL interacts with the policy store

Use the `POLICY_STORE_*` [config options](/getting-started/configuration) to control how OPAL-client interacts the policy store (e.g. OPA)

- Use `POLICY_STORE_POLICY_PATHS_TO_IGNORE` to have the client ignore instruction to overwrite or delete policies. Accepting a list of glob paths, or parent paths (without wildcards) ending with "/\*\*". It does support paths starting with '!' to force to not ignore them: a negated path would always take precedence, so if, e.g., both `!myFolder/**` and `myFolder/subFolder/**` are defined then `myFolder/subFolder/**` will not be ignored.

#### Policy store backup

Opal client can be configured to maintain a local backup file, enabling to restore the policy store to its last known state after a restart, even when server is unavailable.

- Use `OPAL_OFFLINE_MODE_ENABLED=true` to enable storing and loading from backup file.
- The backup file is stored to `OPAL_STORE_BACKUP_PATH` (default value is `/opal/backup/opa.json`) - make sure its directory is mapped to a meaningful mount point
- The backup is exported on SIGTERM (on container graceful shutdown), and every `OPAL_STORE_BACKUP_INTERVAL` seconds (default is 60s).

When the client successfully loads the backup, it would report being ready even if server connection isn't established (thus considered operating at "offline mode")
