# Setup OPAL as Python Packages using the CLI

This guide will teach you how to setup the OPAL Server & Client as a series of python packages using the CLI.

This guide will give you a great insight into understanding the main configurations of OPAL. If you prefer to run OPAL with
pre-built docker images, please follow the guide **[here](/getting-started/running-opal/overview)**.

:::warning IMPORTANT
This guide requires that you have **python 3.7 or greater** installed.

Ideally, install OPAL into a **clean [virtual-env](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)**
would make the workflow easier.
:::

## Setup up the OPAL Client

### Installing the package

Firstly, let's install the `opal-client`.

```sh
pip install opal-client
```

### Installing OPA

Next, we will need to install the policy-agent, or in other words OPA to run alongside the OPAL Client.

For installing OPA, please follow [these instructions](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#1-download-opa.

If you would like OPAL to execute OPA for you, and act as a watchdog for OPA, we need to make sure it can **find the OPA** program
and **make it executable**. To do this, please follow the **[guidance here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3809/how-can-i-make-a-program-executable-from-everywhere)**,
but below is an example of what needs to be added.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/file
```

If you are currently in the directory where you will be adding OPA, you can run:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~
```

:::note
The client **needs network access** to this agent to be able to **administer updates** to it.
:::

### Running the OPAL Client and OPA

To view the general commands and options offered by the `opal-client` command, please run:

```sh
opal-client --help
```

If you need to learn about specific run option configurations and help, please run:

```sh
opal-client run --help
```

Running the OPAL Client:

```sh
opal-client run
```

Just like the server, all top-level options can be configured using environment-variables files like
**[.env / .ini](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/#env-file)** and **command-line options**.

##### The key options to be aware of:

- Use options starting with `--server` to control how the client connects to the server. You will mainly need `--server-url` to
  point at the server.

- Use options starting with `--client-api-` to control how the client's API service is running.

- Use `--data-topics` to control which topics for data updates the client would subscribe to.

- Use `--policy-subscription-dirs` to declare what directories in the repository we should subscribe to.

## Setting up the OPAL Server

### Installing the package

As the first step, we need to **install** the OPAL server. Once installed, we will have access to the
`opal-server` command.

```
pip install opal-server
```

If the command continues to be unavailable, please try deactivationg and then activating your virtual-env.

You can run `opal-server --help` to see **all the options and commands** the package provides.

Running the `opal-server print-config` shows you all the possible **configuration keys and their current values**.

### Running the server

Running the OPAL server is simple.

:::tip run server
You can run the server by typing `opal-server run` in your terminal.
:::

Once the server is running you can check out its **Open-API live docs** at
[as simple documentation](http://localhost:7002/docs) or [a redoc layout](http://localhost:7002/redoc).

Make sure that your server is running on `localhost:7002` to be able to view the above links.

#### Polling Policy from GIT

The most basic way to run the server is just with a GIT repository to watch for policy-changes and have
the flexibility to get the policy directly.

The simplest of these is using a public repository, and simply polling on it with
`OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL` and `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL`.

##### Monitor the OPAL Server every 60 seconds

```sh
OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo.git  opal-server --policy-repo-polling-interval 60 run
```

  </a>
</p>

#### Policy GIT Webhook

A better GIT watching can be achieved via configuring a webhook back to the `OPAL_SERVER`'s webhook route.
Let's assume your server is hosted on `opal.yourdomain.com`. The **webhook URL** will be `opal.yourdomain.com/webhook`.

:::tip
If you need more guidance on configuting webhooks, checkout the **[GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks)**.
:::

##### Create a secret you can share with a webhook provider

You can use `opal-server generate-secret` to create a cryptographically strong secret to use.

Then use `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to configure a secret you can share with the webhook provider to authenticate incoming webhooks.

#### Additional GIT repository settings

Here are some settings that will be useful in adding more control.

##### `POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY`

This will allow you to authenticate to a **private repository**. You can generate
a [Github SSH key here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

The value you pass for the `POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY` can either be a file path, or the contents of the SSH-key - with newlines replaced with `\_`.

##### `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_CLONE_PATH` & `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_MAIN_BRANCH`

These will allow you to control how the repo is cloned.

#### Simple run with Data source configuration

In addition to policy updates as seen in above section, the OPAL Server can also facilitate data updates, directing
OPAL Clients to fetch the needed data from various sources.

You can learn more about **[triggering data updates here](/tutorials/trigger_data_updates)**.

## Running the Server and Client in Secure Mode

### Server Secure Mode

OPAL-server can run in secure mode, signing and verifying [Json Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) for the connecting OPAL-clients.
To achieve this we need to provide the server with a private and public key pair.
In addition we need to provide the server with a master-token (random secret) that the CLI (or other tools) could use to connect to ask it and generate the aforementioned signed-JWTs.

- Generating encryption keys

  - Using a utility like [ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen) we can easily generate the keys (on Windows try [SSH-keys Windows guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/generate-ssh-key-windows-10))
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem
    ```
    follow the instructions to save the keys to two files.
  - If you created the keys with a passphrase, you can supply the passphrase to the server via the `OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` option
  - You can provide the keys to OPAL-server via the `OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` and `OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY` options
  - in these vars You can either provide the path to the keys, or the actual strings of the key's content (with newlines replaced with "\_")

- Master-secret

  - You can choose any secret you'd like, but to make life easier OPAL's CLI include the generate-secret command, which you can use to generate cryptographically strong secrets easily.
    ```sh
    opal-server generate-secret
    ```
  - provide the master-token via `OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN`

- run the server with both keys and and master-secret

  ```sh
  # Run server
  # in secure mode -verifying client JWTs (Replace secrets with actual secrets ;-) )
  # (Just to be clear `~` is the user's homedir)
  export OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=~/opal
  export OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=~/opal.pub
  export OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN="RANDOM-SECRET-STRING"
  opal-server run
  ```

- Once the server is running we can obtain a JWT identifying our client
  - We can either obtain a JWT with the CLI
    ```sh
    opal-client obtain-token $OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN --server-url=$YOUR_SERVERS_ADDRESS
    ```
  - <a name="obtain-token-api"></a>Or we can obtain the JWT directly from the deployed
    OPAL server via its REST API:

```
curl --request POST 'https://opal.yourdomain.com/token' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer MY_MASTER_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "client",
}'
```

This code example assumes your opal server is at https://opal.yourdomain.com and that your master token is `MY_MASTER_TOKEN`. The `/token` API endpoint can receive more parameters, as [documented here](https://opal.permit.io/redoc#operation/generate_new_access_token_token_post).

### Client Secure Mode

- Using the master-token you assigned to the server obtain a client JWT
  ```sh
  opal-client obtain-token $OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN --server-url=$YOUR_SERVERS_ADDRESS
  ```
  You can also use the REST API to obtain the token.
- run the client with env-var `OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN` or cmd-option `--client-token` to pass the JWT obtained from the server

  ```sh
  export OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN="JWT-TOKEN-VALUE`
  opal-client run
  ```

## Running the OPAL Server and Client in Production

### Production run Server

When running the server in production, we should set the server to work with a production server ([GUNICORN](https://gunicorn.org/))
and a backbone pub/sub.

#### Gunicorn

Simply use the `run` command with the `--engine-type gunicorn` option.

```sh
opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
```

- (run `opal-server run --help` to see more info on the `run` command)
- use `--server-worker-count` to control the amount of workers (default is set to cpu-count)
- You can of course put another server or proxy (e.g. NGNIX, ENVOY) in front of the OPAL-SERVER, instead of or in addition to Gunicorn

#### Backbone Pub/Sub

- While OPAL-servers provide a lightweight websocket pub/sub channel for the clients; in order for all OPAL-servers (workers of same server, and of course servers on other nodes) to be synced (And in turn their clients to be synced) they need to connect through a shared channel - which we refer to as the backbone pub/sub or broadcast channel.
- Backbone Pub/Sub options: Kafka, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, Redis
- Use the `broadcast-uri` option (or `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` env-var) to configure an OPAL-server to work with a backbone.
- for example `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run`

#### Put it all together

```sh
OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
```

#### Production run Client

Unlike the server, the opal-client currently supports working only with a single worker process (so there's no need to run it with Gunicorn).
This will change in future releases.
