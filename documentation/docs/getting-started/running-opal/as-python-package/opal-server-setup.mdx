# Setting up the OPAL Server

## Installing the package

As the first step, we need to **install** the OPAL server. Once installed, we will have access to the
`opal-server` command.

```
pip install opal-server
```

If the command continues to be unavailable, please try deactivationg and then activating your virtual-env.

You can run `opal-server --help` to see **all the options and commands** the package provides.

Running the `opal-server print-config` shows you all the possible **configuration keys and their current values**.

## Running the server

Running the OPAL server is simple.

:::tip run server
You can run the server by typing `opal-server run` in your terminal.
:::

Once the server is running you can check out its **Open-API live docs** at
[as simple documentation](http://localhost:7002/docs) or [a redoc layout](http://localhost:7002/redoc).

Make sure that your server is running on `localhost:7002` to be able to view the above links.

### Polling Policy from GIT

The most basic way to run the server is just with a GIT repository to watch for policy-changes and have
the flexibility to get the policy directly.

The simplest of these is using a public repository, and simply polling on it with
`OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL` and `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL`.

#### Monitor the OPAL Server every 60 seconds

```sh
OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo.git  opal-server --policy-repo-polling-interval 60 run
```

### Policy GIT Webhook

A better GIT watching can be achieved via configuring a webhook back to the `OPAL_SERVER`'s webhook route.
Let's assume your server is hosted on `opal.yourdomain.com`. The **webhook URL** will be `opal.yourdomain.com/webhook`.

:::tip
If you need more guidance on configuting webhooks, checkout the **[GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks)**.
:::

#### Create a secret you can share with a webhook provider

You can use `opal-server generate-secret` to create a cryptographically strong secret to use.

Then use `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to configure a secret you can share with the webhook provider to authenticate incoming webhooks.

### Additional GIT repository settings

Here are some settings that will be useful in adding more control.

#### `POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY`

This will allow you to authenticate to a **private repository**. You can generate
a [Github SSH key here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

The value you pass for the `POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY` can either be a file path, or the contents of the SSH-key - with newlines replaced with `\_`.

#### `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_CLONE_PATH` & `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_MAIN_BRANCH`

These will allow you to control how the repo is cloned.

### Simple run with Data source configuration

In addition to policy updates as seen in above section, the OPAL Server can also facilitate data updates, directing
OPAL Clients to fetch the needed data from various sources.

You can learn more about **[triggering data updates here](/tutorials/trigger_data_updates)**.
