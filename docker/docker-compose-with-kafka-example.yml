  # When scaling the opal-server to multiple nodes and/or multiple workers, we use
  # a *broadcast* channel to sync between all the instances of opal-server.
  # Under the hood, this channel is implemented by encode/broadcaster (see link below).
  # At the moment, the broadcast channel can be either: postgresdb, redis or kafka.
  # The format of the broadcaster URI string (the one we pass to opal server as `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI`) is specified here:
