### <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/permitio/opal/issues) or even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker; maybe an issue for your problem already exists, and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide:
- Full logs of OPAL server and OPAL client
- Your configuration for OPAL server and OPAL client
  - i.e.: Docker Compose, Kubernetes YAMLs, environment variables, etc.
  - Redact any secrets/tokens/API keys in your config

### <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/permitio/opal/issues) to our GitHub Repository.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible, along with examples or references to similar features, as this will help us understand your request better.

We encourage you to contribute to OPAL by submitting a [Pull Request](#submit-pr) with your feature implementation and are happy to guide you through the process.

Custom Fetch Providers are a great way to extend OPAL, and we would love to see your implementation of a new fetch provider!
To get started, you can check out the tutorial on how to [Write Your Own Fetch Provider](https://opal.ac/tutorials/write_your_own_fetch_provider).

We are always looking to improve OPAL and would love to hear your ideas!

```bash
export OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo
export OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES={"config":{"entries":[{"url":"http://localhost:7002/policy-data","topics":["policy_data"],"dst_path":"/static"}]}}
export OPAL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:7002
```

More information about the available configurations can be found in the [OPAL documentation](https://opal.ac/getting-started/configuration).

#### Using OPAL CLI
```bash
opal-server run
opal-client run
```

#### Using uvicorn
```bash
uvicorn opal_server.main:app --reload
uvicorn opal_client.main:app --reload
```

### Building the Docker Images

You can build the Docker images for the OPAL server and client using the following commands:
```bash
make docker-build-server
make docker-build-client  # with inline OPA engine
make docker-build-client-cedar  # with inline cedar agent engine
make docker-build-client-standalone  # without inline engine
```

### Running the Documentation Locally

When contributing to the documentation, you can run the documentation locally and preview your changes live.

#### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Setting Up
1. Navigate to the `docs` directory:
    ```bash
    cd documentation
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:

### Running E2E Tests

The E2E tests run OPAL Server and Client in a docker-compose environment and test the core features of OPAL.
They are external to the OPAL packages and are located in the `app-tests` directory.

Read more about how to run the E2E tests in the [app-tests README](app-tests/README.md).
